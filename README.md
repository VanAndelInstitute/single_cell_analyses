# Single Cell Analysis Tools

This repository contains an emerging collection of tutorials focused on analysis
of single cell data. Presently, the focus is on droplet based scRNASeq and
scATACSeq. It also contains introductory material describing how to set up a
bioinformatics server from the ground up to get started.

So far there are the following tutorials here. Bear in mind these are works 
in progress and therefore YMMV.

* [RNA Velocity with Alevin and scVelo](https://vanandelinstitute.github.io/single_cell_analyses/rnavel_alevin_scvelo.html)
