# Introduction

This document attempts to describe analysis of RNA Velocity derived from single
cell RNASeq data starting as close to the very beginning as possible. There are
several algorithms and software packages for performing this analysis. The
approach we take here uses the `alevin` facility of the `salmon` sequence
aligner, followed by the RNA velocity computation algorithm implemented by
`scVelo`. There are other approaches, perhaps most notably `velocyto`. There are
various arguments why one or another algorithm is or is not superior. Frequently
such arguments are an example of gilding the lilly since these analyses are
simply a first step towards a long program of validation in the laboratory.
Given the time and resources involved in that journey of validation, it is good
to take the best first step you can. But it is even more important to **take
that step**. This document is designed to make that step easier. You can then go
on to explore other options for that step as time and interest allow.

Getting your environment set up will require working from the command line. But
once the tools you need are there, the rest of the analysis can be done in an R
session, including from within an RMarkdown document (like this one). We will
make use of the `reticulate` package to call Python from R. (Alternatively you
can do the same thing from Python by embedding R with the rpy2 package. It just
so happens that we are happiest working in RStudio with RMarkdown documents as
our instruments of reproducible research. But, for example, Python and Jupyter
notebooks would be just as fine. What you CAN'T do, it turns out, is use rpy2
from within an R session. If you try to embed an R session in a Python session
embedded in an R session, things get weird.)

**Note** that while shell commands need to be run at the command line, both the
R and Python commands below are meant to be run from within an RStudio RMarkdown
document (such as the one you are reading now). This allows for seamless
intercommunication between the R and Python sessions. You can execute both the R
and Python code segments below within R studio (adjusting as needed for your own
data files).

The analysis proceeds along the following steps:

1. Installation of pre-requisite software components.
2. Downloading and indexing the genome
3. Aligning your sequencing reads to intronic and exonic regions of the genome
4. Performing the RNA Velocity calculation

Finally, this document leans heavily on the [RNA Velocity With
Alevin](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2020/alevin-velocity/)
tutorial from the Combine lab. But it fills in some gaps, and demonstrates how
to complete this analysis completely within an RMarkdown document without
switching to an independent Python session.

# Pre-requisites

This document assumes that you are working in a Linux-ish environment (including
macOS). If you are using Windows, most of what follows should be pretty easy to
follow but you might need to adapt slightly for your environment (for example,
mingw or cygwin).

**Note**: The following has only been thoroughly tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.
If you find any of this is not platform independent, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/VanAndelInstitute/single_cell_analyses/issues) on
github.

If you do not have them already, you will need installations of R and Python. In
addition, some of the required packages need to be built from source which
require build tools (gcc or clang and related tools), and also require the
presence of supporting system libraries (libxml2, libopenssl, etc.) A [Getting
Started
Tutorial](https://vanandelinstitute.github.io/single_cell_analyses/setting_up_shop.html)
is available that covers setting up a server and installing these tools. Please
refer to that document as necessary.

## R packages

Once you have R installed you can install the necessary packages:

```{r}
setRepositories(ind = 1:6)
req <- c("Biostrings",  
         "BSgenome",
         "GenomicFeatures",
         "SummarizedExperiment",
         "eisaR",
         "tximeta",
         "rjson",
         "reticulate",
         "SingleCellExperiment",
         "scater", 
         "ggplot2", 
         "reshape2",
         "org.Hs.eg.db",
         "foreach")
         

ix <- which(!req %in% installed.packages())
if(length(ix))  
  install.packages(req[ix])

```

## Salmon

Salmon can be easily installed using `conda`. We will install it in its own environment, separate from the scvelo environment
we created above, to avoid any dependency collisions.

```{bash}
# in case we are already in an environment
conda deactivate

conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda create -n salmon salmon

# need to update to latest version
conda activate salmon
wget https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/download/v1.2.1/salmon-1.2.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf salmon-1.2.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
cd salmon-latest_linux_x86_64/
cp -R * ~/local/share/miniconda/envs/salmon/

conda deactivate
```

Now the hard part is over. On to mapping and counting.

# Genome index

The next step is to download the appropriate genome fastas and index them. But before we index the genome, we need to do 
some initial steps to facilitate identifying whether a given read aligns to an intronic region, and exonic region, or 
both. 

First we download the genome files. Here we download the human genome. Download an analagous genome for the organism you 
are working with. 

```{bash}
#adjust as needed to point to where you want the data to be stored
cd /mnt/data
mkdir genomes
mdkir genomes/hs34

ROOT_DIR=/mnt/data/genomes/hs34/
cd $ROOT_DIR

curl ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_34/gencode.v34.annotation.gtf.gz \
  -o gencode.v34.annotation.gtf.gz 
  
curl ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_34/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz \
  -o GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz

gunzip GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz

```

We then extract genomic coordinates of introns and exons, with a flank length of 90 (you can adjust the flank size 
depending on the lengths of your transcript reads).

```{r}
# adjust as needed to point to where you want the indexes stored
# don't forget the trailing slash
root_dir <- "/mnt/data/genomes/hs34/"

gtf <- paste0(root_dir, "gencode.v34.annotation.gtf.gz")
fasta <- paste0(root_dir, "GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa")
grl <- getFeatureRanges(
  gtf = gtf,
  featureType = c("spliced", "intron"), 
  intronType = "separate", 
  flankLength = 90L, 
  joinOverlappingIntrons = FALSE, 
  verbose = TRUE
)

```

We then extract just these regions to a new fasta file, and intron/exon annotations to a new gtf.

```{r}
genome <- Biostrings::readDNAStringSet(
    fasta
)
names(genome) <- sapply(strsplit(names(genome), " "), .subset, 1)
seqs <- GenomicFeatures::extractTranscriptSeqs(
  x = genome, 
  transcripts = grl
)

Biostrings::writeXStringSet(
    seqs, filepath = paste0(root_dir, "GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.expanded.fa")
)

eisaR::exportToGtf(
  grl, 
  filepath = paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.gtf")
)
```

We need lookup tables to match introns and exons to eachother and then to gene ids

```{r}
write.table(
    metadata(grl)$corrgene, 
    file = paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.features.tsv"),
    row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE, quote = FALSE, sep = "\t"
)

df <- eisaR::getTx2Gene(
    grl, filepath = paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.tx2gene.tsv")
)

```

We then index these sequences using salmon (and using the whole genome as a decoy to avoid 
lower quality mapping to introns or exons when perfect matches elsewhere exist). 

```{bash}
grep ">" ${ROOT_DIR}GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa | cut -d ">" -f 2 | cut -d " " -f 1 > ${ROOT_DIR}GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.chrnames.txt

salmon index \
-t <(cat ${ROOT_DIR}GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.expanded.fa ${ROOT_DIR}GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa) \
-i ${ROOT_DIR}gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.sidx --gencode -p 10 \
-d ${ROOT_DIR}GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.chrnames.txt

```

And create a linked transcriptome json config file with tximeta

```{r}
tximeta::makeLinkedTxome(
  indexDir = paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.sidx"), 
  source = "GENCODE", genome = "GRCh38", 
  organism = "Homo sapiens", release = "H34", 
  fasta = paste0(root_dir, "GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.expanded.fa"), 
  gtf = paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.gtf"), 
  write = TRUE, jsonFile = paste0(root_dir, "genomes/gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.json")
)

# check
rjson::fromJSON(file = paste0(root_dir, "genomes/gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.json"))

```

Now the hard part is over. Time to align some reads.

# Aligning and counting

Salmon alevin is designed to work with reads generated from 10X chromium chemistry. If you have 
fastqs from V2 or V3 10X Chromium libraries, you are good to go. If you have fastqs with other 
libraries with fixed length barcodes and UMIs, you are also good to go but will need to specify
the barcode and UMI lengths and positions with the `--barcodeLength`, `--umiLength` and `--end` 
parameters. 

## Working with inDrop libraries

What if you have inDrop libraries? The challenge with inDrop libraries is that Barcode 1 can be 
8, 9, 10, or 11 bases long. Salmon alevin cannot deal with variable length barcodes. So, we have 
developed a tool that will take inDrop fastqs and reformat them as if they were 10X genomics 
fastqs, by trimming and/or padding the barcodes and UMIs. Because of the way the barcodes are 
designed, this actually introduces little or no ambiguity in the barcodes, surprisingly enough.

If you need to convert inDrop Fastqs, download the tool, build, and install.

```{bash}
cd ~/build
curl -L https://github.com/vanandelinstitute/intent/archive/master.tar.gz -o intent.tar.gz
tar -zxvf intent.tar.gz
cd intent-master
make

# if you don't have root access, just copy bin/intent somewhere on your path.
# of even just run it from bin/intent. But you can copy it to /usr/local/bin by:
sudo make install
```

Then you can do something along the lines of:

```{bash}
intent Day100_inDrop_L000_R1_001.fastq.gz \
       Day100_inDrop_L000_R2_001.fastq.gz 

```

## Mapping with alevin

And map with alevin. Note that if you do not specify `--forceCells`, then alevin will 
identify the "good" barcodes automatically using a knee plot. But sometimes that does 
not go as expected. So specify your expected cells with `--forceCells` if possible.

Also, if you are not using 10XGenomics chromium V2 style fastqs, you will need to specify
something else in place of `--chromium`. For example, `--chromiumV3`, or explicitly specify 
`--barcodeLength`, `--umiLength` and `--end` (where `--end` is either "5" or "3", specifying 
which end the UMI is on relative to the barcode).

```{bash}
# specify your Read 1 and Read 2 fastq's below.
# you can specify more than 1 for each if your library is split accross multiple
# lanes/runs/etc.
mkdir day60
cd day60

salmon alevin -l ISR -i ${ROOT_DIR}gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.sidx \
-1 day_60_R1.fastq.gz \
-2 day_60_R2.fastq.gz \
-o alevin_out -p 6 --tgMap ${ROOT_DIR}gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.tx2gene.tsv \
--dumpFeatures 
--forceCells 1000 \
--chromium

```

The hard part is over. On to calculating RNA Velocity

# RNA Velocity

We can then import the counts from `alevin` using the txiMeta package in R

```{r}
setwd("day60")

tximeta::loadLinkedTxome(paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.json"))
txi <- tximeta::tximeta(coldata = data.frame(
  names = "Day60",
  files = "alevin_out/alevin/quants_mat.gz", 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
), type = "alevin")
```

We need to extract both the spliced and unspliced counts. 

```{r}
cg <- read.delim(paste0(root_dir, "gencode.vH34.annotation.expanded.features.tsv"),
                 header = TRUE, as.is = TRUE)

## Rename the 'intron' column 'unspliced' to make assay names compatible with scVelo
colnames(cg)[colnames(cg) == "intron"] <- "unspliced"
txis <- tximeta::splitSE(txi, cg, assayName = "counts")
```

Before we export our data into Python for scVelo, let's add some additional annotations that 
will be useful, including both gene annotation and dimensional reductions.

```{r}
library(sceasy)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

txis <- as(txis, "SingleCellExperiment")
assays(txis) <- list(
    counts = assay(txis, "spliced"),
    spliced = assay(txis, "spliced"),
    unspliced = assay(txis, "unspliced")
)

# annotate genes, discarding ones without annotation in org.Hs.eg.db
ix <- which(gsub("\\..*", "", rownames(txis)) %in% ls(org.Hs.egENSEMBL2EG))
txis <- txis[ix,]
ens <- gsub("\\..*", "", rownames(txis))
eg <- mget(ens, org.Hs.egENSEMBL2EG)
eg <- sapply(eg, function(x) { x[1]})
sym <- mget(eg, org.Hs.egSYMBOL)
sym <- sapply(sym, function(x) { x[1]})
rowData(txis)$symbol <- sym
rowData(txis)$entrez <- eg
rowData(txis)$ensembl <- ens

txis <- scater::logNormCounts(txis)
txis <- scater::runPCA(txis)
txis <- scater::runTSNE(txis, dimred = "PCA")

# let's save our work.
saveRDS(txis, "txis.rds")
```

We can now extract the pieces we need to create an anndata 
object that can be imported into a Python session via `reticulate`.

```{r}
library(reticulate)

# adjust paths below as needed
# see above for more information on installing miniconda
use_condaenv("~/local/share/miniconda/envs/scvelo", 
             conda = "~/local/share/miniconda/bin", 
             required = TRUE)

loompy <- reticulate::import('loompy')
anndata <- reticulate::import('anndata', convert = FALSE)

X <- Matrix::t(counts(txis))
obs <- as.data.frame(colData(txis))
var <- as.data.frame(rowData(txis))
counts <- Matrix::t(assay(txis, "spliced"))
spliced <- Matrix::t(assay(txis, "spliced"))
unspliced <- Matrix::t(assay(txis, "unspliced"))
logcounts <- Matrix::t(assay(txis, "logcounts"))
X_PCA <- reducedDim(txis, "PCA")
X_TSNE <- reducedDim(txis, "TSNE")

adata <- anndata$AnnData(
        X = X,
        obs = obs,
        var = var,
        obsm = list(X_PCA = X_PCA,
                    X_TSNE = X_TSNE),
        layers = list(spliced = spliced, 
                      unspliced = unspliced,
                      logcounts = logcounts)
)
```

Now we can drop into an Python session, accessing the `adata` object we just 
created, and run scVelo on our dataset. Again, this can be done right within your 
RMarkdown document, as RStudio now supports Python sessions "out of the box".

```{python}
import scvelo as scv
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('AGG')
scv.settings.set_figure_params('scvelo')

# the anndata object we created above is available here in 
# the 'r' namespace and can be imported by python
scv.utils.show_proportions(r.adata)

scv.pp.filter_genes(r.adata, min_shared_counts = 5)
scv.pp.normalize_per_cell(r.adata, enforce = True)
scv.pp.filter_genes_dispersion(r.adata, n_top_genes = 2000)
scv.pp.log1p(r.adata)

scv.pp.moments(r.adata, n_pcs = 30, n_neighbors = 30)

scv.tl.recover_dynamics(r.adata)
scv.pl.velocity_embedding_stream(r.adata, basis='X_TSNE', layer=['velocity'], color=['leiden'],
                                dpi = 300, use_raw = True, save = 'stream1.png')
```

Voila!

Next we will talk about some optimization including pseudocount inflation to better 
normalize away the effect of library depth, merging multiple samples, and importing back 
into R for further analysis and visualization.
